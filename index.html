<p>Miranda,<br>Happy COVID-19th person! I mean, birthday! Of course by this point, you are entirely aware of how wonderful of a friend you are--in fact, so wonderful, that I can simply say you are nothing but my absolute <em>best</em> friend. It is truly a remarkable pleasure to discover beacons of light like you--people who are interesting, kind, understanding, humorous, and so much more. You have positively influenced my life in so many ways that I will be forever grateful for, and I will always remember the passionate companionship we share.</p>
